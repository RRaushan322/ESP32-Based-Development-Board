## Overview

This repository contains the design files, schematics, and documentation for an ESP32-based development board. The board is designed to be a versatile platform for developing and prototyping IoT and embedded systems projects.

## Features

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The heart of the board, providing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
- **GPIO Breakout**: All ESP32 GPIO pins are broken out for easy access.
- **Power Management**: Onboard voltage regulator with power input options (USB, Battery).
- **Peripherals**:
- **Boot and reset Buttons**: For Reset and troubleshooting .
- **Expansion Headers**: Compatible with standard headers for additional peripherals and modules.
- **USB-Micro B Connector**: For programming and power.
- **LED Indicators**: For power, status, and communication.
